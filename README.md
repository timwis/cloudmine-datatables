CloudMine DataTables
================

This is an example of how to use [DataTables](http://datatables.net) to display, sort, and paginate [CloudMine](http://cloudmine.me) records, fetching only what's displayed. DataTables provides a great tool for browsing tabular data, and this allows you to use it with CloudMine records on a scalable basis - whether you've got 20 records or 20,000. Oh, and it uses Bootstrap CSS, but you can remove that part if you like.

Usage
---------
1. Fill in your CloudMine `appid` and `apikey`
2. Fill in your titles in `aoColumns`
3. Enter your search query in `sAjaxSource`
